# Tanguy Scholtes - npx card

> A CLI visit card - part of BeCode's studentship

* * *


## Installation

No installation needed, as npx can use its black magic to do that for us. You'll need NPM installed for npx to work, though.


## Usage

Simply type in a terminal :

```
npx tanguyscholtes
```

and behold the awesomeness !


## Part of BeCode's studentship

I made this code as a trainee at [BeCode](https://becode.org/). If you'd like to check the exercise's specificities, you can [read it all here](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Hamilton-1.7/tree/master/02-La-colline/02-NodeJS/01-cli) (it's only available in French, thought. Sorry pals !).
